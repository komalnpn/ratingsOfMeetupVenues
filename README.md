# Meetup Events Scraper

This Python script scrapes event data from the Meetup.com website, a popular platform for discovering and joining local communities and events. This project also queries the information of the venue of each of these events through the Google places API to look for the pricing of the place and the ratings. The purpose of this project is to gather a comprehensive dataset of upcoming Meetup events in a specific geographic area, extract detailed information about these events, and make the data accessible to users.

## Data Gathered

The script collects the following information for each Meetup event:

1. Event name
2. Organizer name
3. Number of attendees
4. Event date and time
5. Venue name and address
6. Cost of attendance
7. Event URL
8. Price level (from Google Places API)
9. Rating (from Google Places API)
10. First review (from Google Places API)

This data is then saved to a CSV file for easy access and analysis.

## Value of the Dataset

The dataset generated by this script provides valuable insights into the local Meetup event landscape in a specific geographic area (in this case, within a 2-mile radius of Manhattan, New York). This information can be useful for a variety of users, including:

1. **Event Organizers**: Understand the competition, pricing, and popularity of events in their area to help plan and promote their own events more effectively.
2. **Event Attendees**: Discover new and interesting events happening in their local community, with details on the cost, venue, and reviews to help them make informed decisions.
3. **Researchers and Analysts**: Analyze trends in event types, pricing, attendance, and other factors to gain insights into the local community and its interests.

While Meetup.com provides a platform for discovering and joining events, the data is not readily available in a structured, comprehensive format, giving reviews of the places they are hosting the events in. By scraping and consolidating this information, this project aims to make it more accessible and valuable for a wider range of users.
I think a dataset like this is constantly changing, so it is difficult to find a dataset uploaded. This program leverages on that inavailability to provide all the constantly changing information in a single dataset. 

## Getting Started

To use the Meetup Events Scraper, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone

2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Ensure you have the Chromedriver executable installed and added to your system's `PATH` variable. You can download the appropriate version for your Chrome browser from the [ChromeDriver website](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).

4. Run the Python script:

python main.py

5. The script will start scraping Meetup.com events and output the results to the `meetup_events.csv` file.

6. The console will display a summary of the total number of events scraped.
