We had a reservation and arrived but there was no host to seat us. Had to ask a bartender who brought us to our table. We asked to switch to a different empty table to get a better view of the game but was told by a guy sitting in the back on a laptop (manager? owner?) that those tables were reserved. I told him we had a reservation and he said no they are reserved for someone else. Of course, no one ended up showing up for those two tables and it appears they were reserved so the guy in the back could do his work without being bothered by having customers next to him. The two bartenders both waited on us and there was some confusion and frustration amongst them as to who was our waiter (that's for them to figure out, not us). Other than this, we really enjoyed, the food, drinks, and atmosphere. Not ready to give up on this place because it seems like a nice spot to watch the game and get some great food as well."

We have tried quite a few of them all over Manhattan and Brooklyn, and E's has remained our absolute favorite. The vibe is always casual, friendly, and fun, and ramps up a bit on Friday and Saturday nights. They have a fantastic selection of games, enough that there is always a new one to try even though we have easily been there 20+ times over the last few years. The servers are always laid-back, there are different seating areas depending on the vibe you're looking for, and the burgers are AMAZING. The happy hour deals are also amazing, and incredible that it's most of the day! We have easily spent 5+ hours here on multiple occasions because you just don't want to leave.

We also recently hosted an event here, and it was such an easy and positive experience. Erin was so friendly and incredibly helpful with our options for how to book it, and really took the stress out of any part of the planning process. The day itself was perfectly smooth, and our guests really loved the relaxed and fun vibe of the bar - exactly what we hoped for. Hopefully we'll have a reason to book an event with E's again, but we will for sure be there regularly in the meantime!"

I took Dorit Koppel's ballet class which was AMAZING.  She's a wonderful teacher with great instruction and passion!   I am looking forward to the next time I am nearby and able to drop in for a class.  Their schedule is packed with classes so it's not hard to find something to work with your own schedule!
