The front desk staff were super friendly, checked us in quick, and gave us a ton of great recommendations.

Our room, though, was so small. Not even a closet, just hooks and hangers. We knew this going in though, and agreed to stay here as long as we got a room with a terrace which completely made up for it.

The room looked pretty clean and modern, the shower was great, but there were little things here and there that gave us the impression that could benefit from inspecting the rooms more often. Not a huge deal, but our bathroom door would not stay shut, handles were loose as if they needed to be re-screwed, and we could not turn on desk lamp.

The terrace was *amazing*. It was super big, had an outdoor shower (with a curtain for privacy), and had a nice view. We spent more time on the terrace than in the room.

The wifi was good, the common areas were great for working, and the shop inside the hotel is super convenient. We did get room service when we first checked in, and frankly it was not great, but there’s a ton of better food options nearby.

Overall, the rooms are tiny so if you’re gonna spend a lot of time here it may be a tight fit. But if you can get a terrace room you will not regret it, and if you can’t the common areas are well kept and everything is within walking distance."

You are better off watching videos online or going through Coursera. I got to experience 2 instructors for the data science program. Daniel was great. He was engaging and personable. I ended up having to restart the course and got Joseph. I regretted it. I don't believe he should be a instructor at all. I am speaking from previoulsy holding a job that onboarded new hires and trained them. He was not engaging or personable. His approach was not ideal to say the least. He spoke down to you when in a smaller group setting or one on one. He was distracted by his other job at times. I stop reaxhing out to him when I had a question and just started using Chat GPT to better understand. He did very little and did the bare minimum so he could get out and be done within an hour or so for each lecture. If every instructor was like Daniel then I could promote this school but Joseph did not represent the school well at all. His lectures were 1.5 to 2 hours and made sure to engage on what learned and struggled with at the end of the day. He provided us additional material up front and through the course to reference as well. We neve got that from Joseph until the last day. He sent us a bunch of links and videos that are way better then what he provided us. They record the lectures and keep them on You Tube. I had to go back and watch Daniels lectures after sitting through Joseph's lectures. The github material I recieved from both is similar mostly then you can see where Daniel took time to add more lectures and course work that was beneficial. Its clearly night and day, from the lectures, the engagement, the cohort experience, etc. They last phase was crammed with a bunch of stuff that was, at times, over your head. Joseph lost me and some of the others in the cohort. Their was a time it seemed he was talking non sense, in circles, and redundant jibberish that was not making sense. I checked out after that. We had a capstone project at the end of the course. It had to be reviewed and approved by the instructor. I had to redo my project because he decided it was too easy the day before we were to present it. I had to stay up all night and got done two hours before the presentation. I went from a nice preso to something I had to put together last moment. Mind you he approved the topic and data set, recommended that I do it without the time series, and then told me the day before it was too easy to recreate the neural network project and make a regression model for the project. I was very upset and disappointed in the profressionalism of it all. They need to re-evaluate their instructors. The career coach I am working with told me in the four years that she has worked with them that she has only had one person land a job as a data scientist. There aren't many jobs available on the job board for data science. Its mostly intern stuff or jobs for software engineering and some for cyber security from what I have experienced recently. Spend your time and money elsewhere. I could go on and may edit to add more later. I would not recommend bootcamps personally. It was $15,000+ when you could have spent way less on better material. I could send you the you tube videos and the github material from the course and you could do it all yourself with no added value or benefit of needing to pay the school depending the instructor you get. If you want to break into the field, then do your own work or self teach yourself, create a portfolio of the work, and network on LinkedIn."

I had to go hunt down an employee through the entire store. I found one. He didn't even help at all. He just shrugged his shoulders and said, ""I don't know if they have any,"" and walked away. Didn't call anyone! Then I went t to customer service same thing. No one cared to look or call to see if they had any in the back. Terrible store & customer service! I found the workers to be extremely lazy. I should have asked for a manager, but I have already wasted so much time. Management needs to really get it together with this store! They're understaffed, and no one is around to help on a Thursday evening? I will post a photo of the advertisement below. I will continue to shop at Trader Joe's, Thrive market & other grocery shops. Whole Foods customer service and quality foods both have gone downhill!

I think we ended up paying like $55 each but I forgive because every single comic was actually funny and we didn't have to wait at all. I deem this club officially** underrated.

*I believe it was actually a cigarette, but spiritually it was a cigar
**I have no official position from which to deem this besides my esteemed position as a Google local guide"

Visited Sugar Mouse NYC, and it was an absolute blast! This eclectic 360 immersive game hall and entertainment venue is a perfect blend of fun, games, and a lively atmosphere.

The first thing that struck me was the unique and quirky decor with a laid-back, playful vibe that immediately makes you feel at home. The space is well-designed with plenty of room for all the activities they offer.

No shortage of things to do from ping pong and pool tables to live music and art visuals from wall to wall, there's something for everyone.

The bar offers a fantastic selection of craft cocktails and beers. I tried a few of their signature cocktails, and each one was expertly crafted and delicious.

They also host themed nights and events, which add to the overall fun and inclusive environment.

What a cultural hotspot."
